Pittaluga et Sargeant, LP, is a new investment firm with many brokers and many investors.

This CLI application mimics some of the basic functionality one would expect an investment firm to need for daily operations.

The CLI is text-driven. For both Brokers and Investors, there is a menu for help.

A user of this app may log in with a username and password. There are two types of users, Investors and Brokers. They have respective abilities within the app.

This app has a model for investors, clients, companies, and transactions.

An Investor, who is assigned to a Broker, may look up their broker's contact information. The Investor may direct the broker to buy or sell shares of a stock, and the investor may deposit or withdraw funds from an account. The Investor may also monitor the performance of their own portfolio.

A Broker, who has many Investors as clients, may add a new company for the firm to track. A Broker may create new Investors or Brokers. A Broker may make trades on behalf of the Investor. The Broker may also monitor the performance of portfolios of the clients that they manage.

One more thing . . .
With API calls, a Broker has the ability to quote the latest prices of the tracked securities of the firm.
