On a typical workday,

    1. As a broker, I want to log into the system with a password so that I can go to work.
    2. As a broker, I want to know all of my investors and see their positions.
    3. As a broker, I want to buy or sell stock on behalf of my investors.
    4. As a broker, I want to do some basic CRUD operations. For example:
        4a. Create new investors or brokers
        4b. Read a investor's portfolio. (Access API for entertaining suggestions)
        4c. Update a investor's portfolio by executing trades.
        4d. Delete a user or sell all shares of a company.
